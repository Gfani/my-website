  <h2 id="poem1">I See Humans, Not Humanity</h2>
  <pre>
I walk through streets where silence screams,  
In concrete jungles built from dreams.  
A thousand faces pass me by,  
But not a soul will catch my eye.  

They rush and run and never feel,  
Their laughter sharp, their kindness steel.  
Phones in hand, yet hearts alone,  
We text, we scroll, we break our own.  

I see a child who’s lost and scared,  
But eyes look past, like no one cared.  
A hand could help, a word could heal,  
Yet no one stops to think or feel.  

We build our walls and close our doors,  
Compete in grief, compare our wars.  
And when compassion dares to speak,  
It's mocked as soft, it's seen as weak.  

But what is strength if love is gone?  
What are we fighting battles on?  
I see humans, dressed in pride,  
But the humanity... has stepped aside.
  </pre>

  <h2 id="poem2">Whispers of the Wind</h2>
  <pre>
The wind it whispers through the trees,  
A voice as soft as morning breeze.  
It dances through the golden field,  
Where time and thought are gently healed.  

It tells of tales from long ago,  
Of tears that fell, of hearts that glow.  
It hums through cracks in old stone walls,  
And sings to leaves as autumn falls.  

It moves through windows late at night,  
A lullaby in silver light.  
It knows the words we never say,  
And carries broken dreams away.  

It swirls with laughter in the air,  
And comforts pain we cannot bear.  
It touches cheeks and dries a tear,  
A friend unseen, forever near.  

And when I’m lost in storms within,  
I close my eyes… and hear the wind.
  </pre>

  <h2 id="poem3">Falling into True Love</h2>
  <pre>
I didn’t plan to fall this way,  
It started like a gentle day.  
A smile, a word, a fleeting glance,  
And somehow I was caught in trance.  

You weren’t a flame that burned too bright,  
But steady warmth and quiet light.  
You didn’t shout or stake your claim,  
But whispered softly, all the same.  

I watched you laugh with no disguise,  
And found the stars inside your eyes.  
You saw my flaws, you saw my scars,  
And still you reached between the bars.  

My walls you broke, not with a fight,  
But with your presence, calm and right.  
You turned my fear into a song,  
That sang of home where hearts belong.  

And now, I walk a softer road,  
Because your love has eased my load.  
I didn’t mean to fall so fast...  
But with you here, I hope it lasts.
